# MTrack #
## The programmer's Video Compositor ##
Mtrack is a really simple video compositor. It also allows you to easily input 3d objects (OBJ files) and animate them in 3D. It uses basic OpenGL to render the 3D graphics and GTK3 for the user interface. Due to the awesome benefit afforded by writing your own shaders, Mtrack allows the artist access to the actual shader that is processed on both the video and the individual objects that have been added to the scene, differentiating it from most editing packages.

### TODO Features ###
- Load Video & Add 3D objects
- 3D Object animation
- Spatial reconstruction and camera tracking
